# 🧠 Embedded Driver Development on STM32F446RE

This repository contains custom drivers for **SPI**, **I2C**, **USART**, and **GPIO** developed using **bare-metal C** on the **STM32F446RE** microcontroller. All drivers are written from scratch using **register-level programming**, without relying on HAL or CMSIS libraries.

> 🔬 Developed as part of a 6-week research internship at **DRDO – SAG Lab** under the mentorship of **Mr. Prashant Singh**.

## 📌 Project Objective

To design and implement low-level embedded drivers for core communication protocols on the STM32F446RE MCU and validate them through real hardware-level testing using Arduino and USB-TTL modules.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ SPI Master Driver (Full Duplex)
- ✅ I2C Master Driver (Start, Address, NACK handling)
- ✅ USART Transmit/Receive Driver
- ✅ GPIO Input/Output Driver
- ✅ Register-level programming (No HAL, No CMSIS)
- ✅ Hardware validation with external modules

---

## 🧪 Hardware Testing

Drivers were tested by interfacing the STM32F446RE board with:

- 🔸 **Arduino UNO** (for SPI/I2C testing)
- 🔸 **USB-TTL module** (for USART testing via serial terminals like PuTTY or RealTerm)
- 🔸 **LEDs and Push Buttons** (for GPIO testing)

All communication was validated using logic analyzer traces and terminal outputs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/embedded-driver-stm32.git
   ```

2. **Open in IDE**  
   Import the project into **STM32CubeIDE** or **Keil uVision**

3. **Build and Flash**  
   Connect the Nucleo board via ST-Link and flash the binary

4. **Connect external modules** as described in `main.c`

5. **Observe output** using a serial terminal or logic analyzer
