# ðŸ§  Embedded Driver Development on STM32F446RE

This repository contains custom drivers for **SPI**, **I2C**, **USART**, and **GPIO** developed using **bare-metal C** on the **STM32F446RE** microcontroller. All drivers are written from scratch using **register-level programming**, without relying on HAL or CMSIS libraries.

> ðŸ”¬ Developed as part of a 6-week research internship at **DRDO â€“ SAG Lab** under the mentorship of **Mr. Prashant Singh**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To design and implement low-level embedded drivers for core communication protocols on the STM32F446RE MCU and validate them through real hardware-level testing using Arduino modules.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- âœ… SPI Master Driver (Full Duplex)
- âœ… I2C Master Driver (Start, Address, NACK handling)
- âœ… USART Transmit/Receive Driver
- âœ… GPIO Input/Output Driver
- âœ… Register-level programming
- âœ… Hardware validation with external modules

---

## ðŸ§ª Hardware Testing

Drivers were tested by interfacing the STM32F446RE board with:

- ðŸ”¸ **Arduino UNO** (for SPI/I2C/USART testing)
- ðŸ”¸ **LEDs and Push Buttons** (for GPIO testing)

All communication was validated using logic analyzer traces and terminal outputs.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aadi02anu07/embedded-driver-stm32.git
   ```

2. **Open in IDE**  
   Import the project into **STM32CubeIDE**

3. **Build and Flash**  
   Connect the Nucleo board via ST-Link and flash the binary

4. **Connect external modules** as described in `main.c`

5. **Observe output** using a serial terminal or logic analyzer
